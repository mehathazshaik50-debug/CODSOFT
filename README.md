🐍 PYTHON MINI PROJECTS

✨ OVERVIEW

This repository contains four Python mini projects that demonstrate the use of functions, loops, conditionals, randomization, and user interaction.
Each task is independent and can be executed separately.

🧾 PROJECT LIST
🧩 Task No.	💡 Project Name	🧠 Description
1️⃣	To-Do List Application	Add, view, and remove daily tasks
2️⃣	Calculator + Age Calculator	Perform arithmetic operations and calculate your age
3️⃣	Password Generator	Create strong, random passwords
4️⃣	Rock–Paper–Scissors Game	Play a fun game against the computer
🧩 TASK 1: TO-DO LIST APPLICATION
📌 Description

A simple command-line To-Do List Manager that allows users to:

➕ Add new tasks

📋 View existing tasks

❌ Remove completed tasks

⚙️ Features

Interactive text-based menu

Validates task number before removing

Displays all tasks neatly

▶️ Example Output
--- TO-DO LIST MENU ---
1. View Tasks
2. Add Task
3. Remove Task
4. Exit
Enter choice: 2
Enter a new task: Finish internship project
Task 'Finish internship project' added successfully!

🔢 TASK 2: CALCULATOR + AGE CALCULATOR
📌 Description

This program includes two tools in one:
1️⃣ Simple Calculator – performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2️⃣ Age Calculator – calculates your current age based on your birth year.

⚙️ Features

Uses datetime module to get the current year

Menu-based system

Handles numeric inputs cleanly

▶️ Example Output
--- AGE CALCULATOR ---
Enter your birth year (e.g. 2000): 2002
You are 23 years old in 2025.

🔐 TASK 3: PASSWORD GENERATOR
📌 Description

A program that generates strong, random passwords using:

🔤 Letters (uppercase + lowercase)

🔢 Numbers

🔣 Special characters

⚙️ Features

Lets users set desired password length

Uses Python’s random and string libraries

Ensures password complexity and randomness

▶️ Example Output
--- PASSWORD GENERATOR ---
Enter desired password length: 10
Generated Password: aD7@tY!m#1

🪨 TASK 4: ROCK–PAPER–SCISSORS GAME
📌 Description

A fun and interactive user vs computer game that simulates the classic Rock–Paper–Scissors challenge.

⚙️ Features

🎲 Random computer choice using the random module

✅ Input validation for valid options

🔁 Option to replay multiple rounds

▶️ Example Output
--- ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS GAME ---
Choose rock, paper, or scissors: rock
Computer chose: scissors
You win!
Play again? (yes/no): no
Thanks for playing! Goodbye!

🧠 CONCEPTS USED

🧩 Functions – modular and reusable code blocks

🔁 Loops – for continuous menu interaction

⚙️ Conditionals – to control program flow

🧮 Arithmetic & Logic – for calculations and decisions

🎲 Randomization – used in password generation and games

🕒 Datetime – to calculate user age dynamically

🖥️ HOW TO RUN
🪶 Requirements

Python 3.8 or higher

⚙️ Steps to Run

1️⃣ Save each task in separate files:

task1_todo.py

task2_calculator.py

task3_password_generator.py

task4_rps_game.py

2️⃣ Open your terminal or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

3️⃣ Run any program using:

python filename.py


4️⃣ Follow the on-screen instructions for interaction.
